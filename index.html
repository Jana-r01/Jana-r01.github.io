          <h2 id="2">Why Reading?</h2>
          <p>A single good-sized book will provide you with many hours of entertainment, it will make you think about aspects of the world around you and reconsider those aspects a little.Even better, that single book can be acquired for practically nothing.</p>
          <p>The hobby of reading gets one to disconnect from everything around and dive into a whole different world that can be so far from reality and logic sometimes. It is also a great way to expand one’s mind and enrich one’s language and vocabulary.</p>
          <ol>Some benefits of reading:
            <li>improves brain connectivity,</li>
            <li>increases your vocabulary and comprehension,</li>
            <li>empowers you to empathize with other people,</li>
            <li>aids in sleep readiness,</li>
            <li>reduces stress,</li>
            <li>lowers blood pressure and heart rate,</li>
            <li>fights depression symptoms,</li>
            <li>prevents cognitive decline as you age and so many more.</li>
         <p>Not to mention that you can learn so much from books and can tip your toes in so many different sectors, from life lessons, business strategies, historical events, psychological cases to cooking and chess.</p>
