          <p>The hobby of reading gets one to disconnect from everything around and dive into a whole different world that can be so far from reality and logic sometimes. It is also a great way to expand one’s mind and enrich one’s language and vocabulary.</p>
          <p>Some benefits of reading:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>improves brain connectivity,</li>
            <li>increases your vocabulary and comprehension,</li>
